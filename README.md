# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-Using-Different-Machine-Learning-Models-
In this project, I conducted EDA and used Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks to predict heart attack risks, achieving notable accuracy. This showcases my skills in EDA, algorithm implementation, model comparison, and evaluation, highlighting data science's potential in healthcare for early risk assessment.
# Problem Statement
A heart attack (Cardiovascular diseases) occurs when the flow of blood to the heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked. From WHO statistics every year 17.9 million dying from heart attack. The medical study says that human life style is the main reason behind this heart problem. Apart from this there are many key factors which warns that the person may/maynot getting chance of heart attack.
# Dataset and Methodolgy
This dataset contain some medical information of patients which tells whether that person getting a heart attack chance is less or more. Using the information explore the dataset and classify the target variable using different Machine Learning models and findout which algorithm suitable for this dataset.
